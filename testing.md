### Initial test to ensure this Flask project is correctly set up

from flask import Flask


app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route("/")
def index():
    return "Hello, world!"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(
        host=os.environ.get("IP", "0.0.0.0"),

        debug=True
    )
```

Upon opening the port in the CLI, I'm pleased to say the following browser window opened:
